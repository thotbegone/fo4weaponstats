# Fallout 4 Weapon Statistics
### *Please note, this tool is still in development.*
## Intro
For the live site, go [here](https://thotbegone.github.io/fo4weaponstats/).
All page dropdowns and values are generated depending on the weapon. Nothing is hard-coded which allows for continual updating of the database with minimal changes to the core code.
## Development goals
Eventually I’d like for this site to be styled for Fallout 4, maybe a Pip-Boy type interface. For now, most of what I’m working on is functionality in the form of weapon files. Glorified data entry into my CouchDB. If anyone wants to contribute, that’s probably the easiest and best way to help right now.
